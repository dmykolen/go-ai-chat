Decisions:
- Call 'getAccountData' to check the status of the account, balances, and active services.
- Analyze the response
    - If not enough information, call 'getRelevantDocuments' to search for relevant documents in the knowledge base.
    - If the information is enough, provide a response based on the analysis.
