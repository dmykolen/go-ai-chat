## Never ask:

- verify user umber on another device

## Best practices:
- If you need gather more information(account info or technical info about services,tariffs,errors) to assist the user, set true for "nextAgent", set empty for "clarifyingQuestion"
- If user already provided the necessary information (MSISDN number), set empty for "clarifyingQuestion"
- if you're not sure, don't try to answer it yourself. Allow other AI agents to saturate the context by specifying true for "nextAgent"
- if "IsValidQuery" == false, then "nextAgent" should be false
